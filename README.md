Currently working on v0.1.

### How to install
Simply paste these files on whatever soundpack you're using. It merely adds simple vehicle sounds that will be expanded in future versions.

### What's coming up?
The purpose here is to add the missing sound effects in the game so I can finally call this a soundpack. It uses 2ch soundpack as a base.


The upcoming v0.1 will add missing miscellaneous sounds in the game, stuff like chopping down a tree, ringing the church bells, etc. will have their proper sound effects.
