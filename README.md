Currently working on v0.3 (31/05/2019).

### Vehicle sfx
They are extremely basic and might sound somehow clunky, but that will change since they will be expanded. Don’t feel surprised if your death mobile ends up sounding like a normal car, that’s how it is for now and suggestions are welcome

### What’s the goal of @'s soundpack?
To simply add missing sounds from the game in order to enhance the experience. It uses 2ch soundpack as a base and I really don’t intend on replacing all the sound effects there, just add.


### Music

Removed music.

### Environment effects

Removed indoor effects as these were buggy.
