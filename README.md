Currently working on v0.1.

### Vehicle sfx
They are extremely basic and might sound somehow clunky, but that will change since they will be expanded. Don’t feel surprised if your badass truck ends up sounding like a normal car, that’s how it is for now and suggestions are welcome

### How to install
Simply paste these files on whatever soundpack you're using. It merely adds simple vehicle sounds that will be expanded in future versions.

### What’s the goal of @'s soundpack?
To simply add missing sounds from the game in order to enhance the experience. It uses 2ch soundpack as a base and I really don’t intend on replacing all the sound effects there, just add.


It’s named like that because so many people have worked on this soundpack that I think it’s unfair to give just one all the credits.

### What's coming up?

The purpose here is to add the missing sound effects in the game so I can finally call this a soundpack. It uses 2ch soundpack as a base.

The upcoming v0.1 will add missing miscellaneous sounds in the game, stuff like chopping down a tree, ringing the church bells, etc. will have their proper sound effects.
